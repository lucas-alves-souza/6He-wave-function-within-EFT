# Study of the three-body wave function of 6He within halo-EFT

In this study I take the effective field theory (EFT) approach to investigate the three-body bound states of 6He. 
My main objective is to reproduce results of C. Ji,  C. Elster,  and D. R. Phillips [Phys. Rev. C,
90:044004 (2014) doi:10.1103/PhysRevC.90.044004].

My notes are in the pdf file.
